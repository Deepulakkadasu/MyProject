PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT:

import java.util.Scanner;

class SmartLight {
    private boolean isOn;

    public SmartLight() {
        isOn = false;
    }

    public void turnOn() {
        isOn = true;
        System.out.println("Light turned on");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        isOn = false;
        System.out.println("Light turned off");
    }

    public boolean isLightOn() {
        return isOn;
    }
}

public class HomeAutomationSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmartLight light = new SmartLight();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Current light status: " + (light.isLightOn() ? "On" : "Off"));
            System.out.println("Enter 'on' to turn on the light, 'off' to turn it off, or 'exit' to quit:");

            String userInput = scanner.nextLine();

            if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("on")) {
                light.turnOn();
            } else if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("off")) {
                light.turnOff();
            } else if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
                System.out.println("Exiting the home automation system.");
                break;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter 'on', 'off', or 'exit'.");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}







Explanation:
1.	The program defines a SmartLight class that models a smart light. It has methods to turn the light on (turnOn()), turn it off (turnOff()), and check whether the light is currently on (isLightOn()).
2.	The HomeAutomationSystem class is the main class that drives the simulation. It creates an instance of SmartLight and uses a Scanner to read user input from the command line.
3.	The program enters a loop where it displays the current status of the light and prompts the user for input.
4.	If the user enters "on," the program calls the turnOn() method of the SmartLight instance to turn the light on.
5.	If the user enters "off," the program calls the turnOff() method of the SmartLight instance to turn the light off.
6.	If the user enters "exit," the program prints a message and exits the loop, thus ending the simulation.
7.	If the user enters any other input, the program displays an error message.
This program provides a simple interactive simulation of a home automation system controlling a smart light. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the console interaction with a graphical user interface or mobile app, and integrate hardware components to control actual devices.
